# AMG8833

## Things to do
1. Install bridge libraries from Arduino. Install OneWire-master-zip and OWGridEye-master.zip
2. Make sure hardwares are connected
3. Run read_data_continous.ino to keep on reading the 8x8 temperature pixel data from AMG8833 with 2Hz

### Side-note
This part will measure temperatures ranging from 0°C to 80°C (32°F to 176°F) with an accuracy of +- 2.5°C (4.5°F). It can detect a human from a distance of up to 7 meters (23) feet. With a maximum frame rate of 10Hz
